Java Source Codes from Personal Projects

This desktop app is like a digital vault where files can be stored.

It is secured by a passcode or a physical key (a file in an external storage).

Up to 3 keys may be used at a time, which can be updated, changed or removed.




Didn't have the time to finish this project. 
Missing:
1. binary comparison of key in db vs key from flashdrive
2. UI adaptiveness
3. Fix for bugs when double-clicking an item from a sorted table
